# Java Calculator CLI

A simple and interactive calculator built with Java for the command line interface (CLI).  
It supports basic arithmetic operations and a few advanced ones, with input validation and a clean loop-based structure.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with division-by-zero check)
- Exponentiation (using custom logic)
- Square Root (of the first number)
- Percentage calculation

## ðŸ’» How It Works

The program runs in a continuous loop, prompting the user to:

1. Enter two numbers
2. Choose an operation (1 to 7)
3. View the result
4. Choose whether to continue or exit

Invalid numeric input is handled gracefully with proper prompts.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Java 17+ (compatible with earlier versions as well)
- Standard input/output using `Scanner`
- Basic control structures: loops, conditionals, switch-case
- Functions for modularization

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
